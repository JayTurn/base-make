Base Drupal 7 Make File

This is the drush make file used for Technocrat builds. We use this make file
as a foundation for all of our sites. We are sharing this make file so others
can learn from us and we can get feedback.

Some entries in the make file are used for many of our site builds, but they
aren't appropriate for all builds. These modules have been retained to make it
easier to include them.

This file will be updated periodically. Please submit suggestions and 
improvements using the github bug tracker.
